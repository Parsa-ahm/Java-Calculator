# Calculator Application
## Overview
This project is a simple graphical calculator application that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator features a user-friendly interface with buttons for numbers and operations, as well as a display for the result.

## Features
### Basic Arithmetic Operations: 
The calculator supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
### Graphical User Interface (GUI): 
A simple and intuitive interface created using Java Swing.
### Responsive Design: 
The calculator is designed to respond to user input efficiently and displays results in real-time.
## Technologies Used
### Java: The core programming language used for developing the calculator's functionality.
### Java Swing: Used for creating the graphical user interface (GUI) components such as buttons, panels, and text fields.
### AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit): Utilized for handling GUI components and events.



## What I Learned
### GUI Development with Java Swing: 
I learned how to create a responsive and interactive user interface using Java Swing, which included managing layout, handling user inputs, and updating the display dynamically.
### Event Handling in Java: 
I gained experience in implementing ActionListeners to handle events like button clicks, allowing the calculator to perform operations based on user input.
### Object-Oriented Programming Principles: 
This project reinforced my understanding of object-oriented programming, particularly in organizing the calculator's functionality into methods and managing state with class variables.

## How to Run
Ensure you have JDK (Java Development Kit) installed on your system.
Compile the Calculator.java file using the following command:

javac Calculator.java

Run the compiled program:
java Calculator
